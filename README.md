# Decision-Tree-and-Support-Vector-Machine-for-Anomaly-Detection-in-Water-Distribution-Networks
Drinking water these days has to be monitored as it may contain several life-threating diseases and can also be affected by pollution. Therefore, it is highly required to make sure that there isnâ€™t any water intrusion and to predict the levels of pollution beforehand. In this project, we used 3 Machine learning algorithms, namely, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and KNN, to analyse and detect the presence of intrusion from the water dataset, which was obtained from a treatment plant for water located in Tunisian.
